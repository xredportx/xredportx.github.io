            <p>
                We initially met on tinder. I didn't mean to match.
                Then you messaged me. "Hey! You..., me..., pasta..." or something like that. 
                I didn't really want to go on our first date. 
                I was just sick of people but because Chase used my line "What do you have to lose?" 
                I went on the date. <span class="annotation">-Im glad i did.-</span> 
                We went to El Toril. I was so nervous I shook your hand! 
                <span class="annotation">-I will never live this down.-</span>
                We went to order food and that happened so quickly I don't even remember what I ordered. <span class="annotation">-Probably the burrito-</span>
                All i do remember is that you loved the salsa. 
                i could tell you were a little nervous.Our food came, you didn't really seem to like the food you got. 
                I offered to have you get something else you instated you were just not hungry.
                We sat there for what felt like seconds. <span class="annotation">-It was more like two hours-</span>
                All i could think about was "I don't want this to end."
                One of us brought up doing something else. 
                We got the check I insisted on paying, wanted to make a good impression.
                It was kinda funny when we got outside. 
                I was like do you want to take my car. 
                Before you got in all I remember was telling you take a photo of the plate to make sure others know who you are with.
